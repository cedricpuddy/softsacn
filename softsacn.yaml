# I think of two major likely ways we would want to refer to palette colours:
# 1) by "Position", where we are cycling through the available colours in a specific
#    sequence (eg: 1,2,2,3,3,2,2,1 and repeat to make a double lamp bounce pattern)
# 2) by "colour", but for building patterns, this is probably less common
# 3) since this is a library, we can embed inputs/variables/ranges for function calls!
#    perhaps like this: "christmas_a2022 = 
#     {"name":"red","rgb":"128,128,128","functionname":{"param1":"val1","param2":"val2"}}
#    then in an effect function, we can say "if cfg['palettes']['christmas_a2022']['funcname']:"
